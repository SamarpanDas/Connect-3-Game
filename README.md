# Connect-3-Game
This is a Game that can be run on Android Devices, it is similar to the popular Tic Tac Toe game.

This game mainly uses Java for it's back end features. 
XML has largely been used to build its User interface.

The rules of being victorious in this game is very much the same as that in Tic tac Toe i.e. the player who gets his coins consequtively in 3 boxes be it vertically, horizontally or diagonally wins the game.
